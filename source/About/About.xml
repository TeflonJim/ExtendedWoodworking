Wood may be painted in different colours. The available colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Black.

A Woodworking table is available to paint wood or convert specific types of wood to the original wood type (generic wood).

Cost lists, ingredient lists, and fuel lists are updated for each mod.
