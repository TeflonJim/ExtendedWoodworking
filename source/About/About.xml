This mod changes trees so that when they are cut down, they produce wood of that tree type. Different wood types have slightly different properties.

Wood may be painted in different colours. The available colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Black.

A Woodworking table is available to paint wood or convert specific types of wood to the original wood type (generic wood).
