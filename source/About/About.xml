[h1]Extended Woodworking[/h1]

This is an update of the Extended Woodworking mod (A13). All credit for the original creative work goes to ItchyFlea. https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=7893.0

Previous versions of this module can be downloaded from GitHub:

https://github.com/TeflonJim/ExtendedWoodworking/releases

This release supports RimWorld 1.0 to 1.6.

This mod changes trees so that when they are cut down, they produce wood of that tree type. Different wood types have slightly different properties.

Wood may be painted in different colours. The available colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Black.

A Woodworking table is available to paint wood or convert specific types of wood to the original wood type (generic wood).

This mod does not include an options menu. Painted wood may be disabled using the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3230046902]Cherry Picker[/url] mod. A predefined list is available for painted woods "Extended Woodworking: Enable painted wood".

Alternatively, mod content is expressed using LoadFolders.xml in the mod folder. The first line for each version can be deleted to disable painted woods and associated recipes:
[code]&lt;li&gt;Conditional/1.x/_EW-Painted&lt;/li&gt;[/code]
