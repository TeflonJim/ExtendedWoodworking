The following mods contain floors, the defs are duplicated for each available wood type. A drop down list is added to allow material selection:

%SUPPORTED_FLOOR_MODS%

Incompatible mods:

* Simple Chains: Lumber

The original version of Extended Woodworking inspired a number of mods including the two listed above. It is not possible to create compatiblity patches for the mods above.
