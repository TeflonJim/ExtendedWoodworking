This is an update of the Extended Woodworking mod (A13). All credit for the original creative work goes to ItchyFlea. https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=7893.0

Previous versions of this module can be downloaded from GitHub:

https://github.com/TeflonJim/ExtendedWoodworking/releases

This release supports RimWorld 1.0 and 1.1.

This mod changes trees so that when they are cut down, they produce wood of that tree type. Different wood types have slightly different properties.

Wood may be painted in different colours. The available colours are: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Black.

A Woodworking table is available to paint wood or convert specific types of wood to the original wood type (generic wood).

* [T] MoreFloors
* A Dog Said... Animal Prosthetics
* A RimWorld of Magic
* Area Rugs
* Children, school and learning
* Expanded Prosthetics and Organ Engineering
* Fertile Fields
* GloomyFurniture
* Misc. Training
* RimWriter - Books, Scrolls, Tablets, and Libraries
* VGP Xtra Trees and Flowers

Cost lists, ingredient lists, and fuel lists are updated for each mod.

The following mods contain floors, the defs are duplicated for each available wood type. A drop down list is added to allow material selection:
